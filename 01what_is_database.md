## Two types of Databases
### Relational Databases (SQL Database)
- organize data into tables
- each table has columns and rows
- a unique key identifies each row

### Non-Relational (no-SQL / not just SQL Database)
- organize data not into tables
- key-value stores
- documents (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Graphs
- Flexible tables

## Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
examples:
- mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

- Used to perform CRUD operations, and other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc.)
- Used to define tables and structures
- SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

## Database Queries
